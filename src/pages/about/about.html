    <h2>What Are Local Loops?</h2>
	<p>A local loop is money that travels around the local economy. You spend with local shops, who buys from local suppliers, who employs local people. The money doesn't leave the system it loops around it.</p>

      This app is designed to highlight and make visible local spending and to keep track of it as it moves around the local economy. It is inspired by the Local Multiplier work done my done by the New Economics Foundation and operates according to the principles of the Quadruple Bottom Line, as designed by The Small Green Consultancy. This app is the work of Shadowcat Systems Ltd and The Small Green Consultancy Ltd.

      Points are generated on the value of your spend and re-spend. If the receipt you submit is designated “local” defined by postcode to postcode, then you are awarded one point per £10 spent, or fraction thereof. Further points are awarded when the money you have spent is re-spent by the business you spent with. The number of points awarded halves with each successive re-spend. ie. 1, 0,5, 0,25 etc.

      What we consider local is variable. For some goods and services, food, for instance, local might be a 20 or 30 like radius whereas, for other things like digital technology companies, local might be the town you live in. The key thing we measure is how things are local relative to you. And what we are looking for is for spending that stays in the local area and which, ultimately, in the case of your own spending, returns to you.
